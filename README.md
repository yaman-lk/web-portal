ðŸ”˜ css and scripts are already added to the angular.json(space, space)
ðŸ”˜ so you are no need to care about css and scripts(space, space)
ðŸ”˜ use the suitable html files in template for the pages that you are creating

**images may not show in your pages**
images links provided in html files are not matching with the angular relative paths, so care about it
( see how image links are used in home page and use that way in your html files too )
